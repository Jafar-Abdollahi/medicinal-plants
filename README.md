For the protection of natural resources, plants are of central importance. Identification of plant species offers important knowledge on the categorization and properties of plants. Many plants are richly having medicinal ingredients and contain medicinal active ingredients. The identification of these plants is immediately necessary because of the need for mass production. The manual identification of medicinal plants takes time and the assistance of plant identification experts is necessary. To solve this problem, it is essential for human beings to automatically recognize and classify medicinal plants. Among AI technologies, deep learning has demonstrated strong performance in many automated image-recognition applications. The aim of this study was to develop and test a deep learning system capable of Identification of Medicinal Plant.
